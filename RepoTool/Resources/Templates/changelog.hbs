Create a changelog for the above changes with the below guidelines:
- Use the original files for context around a change.
- Do not make the reason a copy of the description, it is to be a reasonable point of why the change was or might have been made
- Do not include redundant changes like adding and removing the same file, only the end result. 
- Surround code-like names with `backticks`.
- Be quite strict with the quality assessments, only mark highly if the implementation is truly exceptional.
- Consider ratings with only the code introduced in the commit, not the context original files.
